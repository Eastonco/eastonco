# Welcome to the party 🎉
### I'm Connor, a Software Engineer currently working at Expedia Group
Here on GitHub you'll find a handful of my old projects including my [website](https://eastonco.net), a [printer connected to my desk](https://printer.eastonco.net) , and a bunch of other miscelanous school asignments and side quests. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:eastonco@icloud.com) 💌
